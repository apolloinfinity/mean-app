Original Tutorial is from Brad Travery's [MeanAuthApp](https://github.com/bradtraversy/meanauthapp)

I have update the project to use more modern syntax and a bit of dependency injection.

The original project uses passport.js but I am not a big fan of using a monolithic module for something rather simple.
Instead I used [Permit.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/permit) for this project. 

Front-end has been updated to use Angular 10+ and some of the original code used for this project has changed since Angular 5+.# mean-app-tut
